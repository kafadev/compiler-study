# compiler-study
My study of compilers based on Crafting Interpreters and LLVM (later on). I'm following the book to a tee, so you might see lots of comments, lots of copied code segments, and lots of my own notes in the midst of all of it. The completed version can be found on the original repo with cleaned code.
